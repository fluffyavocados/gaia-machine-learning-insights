# Machine Learning Insights into Gaia Exoplanet Candidates

This repository is the code for my bachelor thesis on Machine Learning Insights into Gaia Exoplanet Candidates. We use data from the Gaia DR3 dataset to try and differentiate binaries from substellar companions with the machine learning models Random Forest and XGBoost. 

## Getting started
1. Install requirements into virtual env
2. Run notebook data_preprocessing.ipynb to create the dataset
3. Run notebook random_forest.ipynb for Random Forest analysis
4. Run notebook XGBoost.ipynb for XGBoost analysis
